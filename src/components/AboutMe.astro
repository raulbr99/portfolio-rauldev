      My name is <strong>Raul Berna Riera</strong>. I started programming 8
      years ago playing with <strong>Scratch</strong>. Now, at the age of 24,
      I'm developing several websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am currently thinking of moving to <strong>Ireland</strong> to continue growing
      professionally and looking for new challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am passionate about the world of <strong>software development</strong>,
      so in my free time I keep creating and learning new personal projects with
      different technologies.
